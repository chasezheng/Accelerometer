## Solid Structure Mapping with Android Accelerometer:
This is part of a project at UC Berkeley with Prof. Sitar to develop affordable and mobile tools to map solid structures.
- Map solid layers by tracing the propogation of shockwaves
- Detect echos of shockwave from sublayers with autocorrelation
- Determine changes in solid composition by the dampening and speed of shockwaves
- Extract signal by cross-correlation and stacking
- Primary use case: map outdoor underground soil and rock stuctures

This is an application with a mainActivity that displays current sensor value and current time, together with a service that can log sensor values to files with as much precision as possible.

- Allows user-controlled frequency 
- Allows user-scheduled logging start time
- Notifies users when device sleeps during background logging.
