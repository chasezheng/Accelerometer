## Mobile Geophone with Android:
This is part of a project at UC Berkeley with Prof. Rector to develop affordable and portable replacement for geophones.
 - Primary use case: capture and monitor mechanical waves transmitted through ground in outdoor environment, in order to monitor traffic or weather, and it can be used to map underground rock layers or soil composition.

This is an application with a mainActivity that displays current sensor value and current time, together with a service that can log sensor values to files with as much precision as possible.

- Allows user-controlled frequency 
- Allows user-scheduled logging start time
- Notifies users when device sleeps during background logging.
